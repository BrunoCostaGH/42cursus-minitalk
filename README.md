# 42cursus-minitalk ([Subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/57707/en.subject.pdf))

## Description
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

## Usage

On a Linux Terminal execute the server, followed by executing the client with the pid provided by server and the message to send to server.

```unix
  ./server
  ./client [server_PID] [message_to_transmit]
```

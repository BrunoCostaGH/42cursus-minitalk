# 42cursus-minitalk ([Subject](/.github/en.subject.pdf))

## Description
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

## Usage

On a Linux Terminal execute the server, followed by executing the client with the pid provided by the server and the message to send to the server.

```unix
  ./server
  ./client <server_PID> <message_to_transmit>
```
